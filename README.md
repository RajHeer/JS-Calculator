# JS-Calculator

JS Calculator with range of feature and clean, crisp design. See [here](https://rajheer.github.io/JS-Calculator/).

## About

Final project for The Odin Project (Foundation) cirriculum. Instructions are [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator).

## Implemented

1. Handling inputs of unspecified length from user (i.e. number values entered for calc operations). REGEX matching for numbers and operands, driving conditional logic for function outputs. Use of optional capture groups and insertion to amend number sign.

2. UX and feedback via 'live' tally of input numbers, operations and outputs. Pressing operator keys (i.e. '+, -, *, /, =') updates the display screen with the current output.

3. Screen text resizes according to amount of content to dislay.

4. CSS grid for layout. Transition events and CSS amended by JS, triggered by listeners.

## To do

1. Refactor code (set up calculator module, use closure, remove global variables etc);

2. Refactor large display function (split logic into smaller functions which are called in turn).
