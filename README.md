# JS-Calculator

IN PROGRESS - JS Calculator. See [here] (https://rajheer.github.io/JS-Calculator/.)

## About

Final project for The Odin Project (Foundation) cirriculum. Instructions are [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator).

## Implemented

1. Handling inputs of unspecified length from user (i.e. number values entered for calc operations). REGEX matching for numbers and operands, driving conditional logic for function outputs.

2. UX and feedback to user with 'live' tally of input numbers, operations and outputs. Pressing operator keys (i.e. '+, -, *, /, =') updates the display screen with the current output.

3. CSS grid for layout. Basic styling for clean calculator.

## To do

1. Percentage (%) function handling. Change numbers to positive and negative. Rounding decimals /setting max length for displayed number in screen.

2. Delete/back button to amend display.

3. User provided feedback on hovering/ pressing buttons.
