# JS-Calculator

IN PROGRESS - JS Calculator.

## About

Final project for The Odin Project (Foundation) cirriculum. Instructions are [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator).

## Expecting to learn the following / Initial response to brief

1. Handling inputs of unspecified length from user (i.e. number values entered for calc operations). Expect to build long numbers as strings (and not sum single digits as they're pressed) and convert to integers to perform operations.

2. UX and feedback to user / keeping 'live' tally of input numbers, operations and outputs. Calculator implementation whereby output of pressing operator keys (i.e. '+, -, *, /') updates the display screen with the current output; keep entire running calculation in the display?

3. Using CSS grid and placing elements to span different rows / columns(i.e. display panel at the top of the calculator; '=' button if taking up larger space as seen on some calculator layouts).

4. Styling by placing (invisible) keys and a display to overlay on image of a retro calculator? Or style own with toggle for light / dark theme?
